Phase Coherence Signal
A lightweight KayGee-derived measurement.
If philosopher loops are oscillating chaotically, phase coherence drops.
System health signal indicating genuine novelty or paradox.
Convergence = defensible answer.
Divergence = genuinely contested terrain.
Oscillation in a pattern = self-referential or paradoxical.
